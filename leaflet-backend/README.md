The idea was to create a map/forum for finding various, genetically unique, heirloom strains of cannabis around the world, from the Himalayas to Brazil. I think that unique genetics that are less hybridized and worked by humans are going to become important to reduce an overall inbreeding depression throughout the US cannabis gene pool. 

The main problem I had was, how on earth do I verify some farmer who lives on the side of the himalayas at 12,000 feet? I don't wanna be too closed minded, but I don't think we'll just be able to hop on zoom, or that he'll have any reason to verify his weed field for some other people in America.
