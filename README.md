# Landrace-finder
An interactive map to locate heirloom cannabis strains around the world.


The goal was to locate and document heirloom/landrace cannabis strains from around the world for further preservation as the cannabis gene pool in America is becoming more and more hybridized. I think at some point, a large % of growers are going to want to incorporate different landraces into their breeding programs to instill more vigor, unique cannabinoids, etc into the genetics they're working with. 

In the pursuit of high THC %, many other cannabinoids have fallen by the wayside. There are are 100+ other cannabinoids in cannabis. A lot of these heirlooms from around the world have the cannabinoids that we lack. It's essentially a capitalist market forcing people to breed for THC % because or monkey brains need a measurement to know what "the best" is. The reality is that its more of an "Entourage effect". High THC !== Better. Its like saying Everclear is the best alcohol because its the strongest.

Anyway, the big problem I ran into is how would I verify people? What incentive is there for some farmer in Nepal to put his stuff on the internet? I also don't know that some of these people even have access to a computer. On top of that, there are also bad people in the world who probably dont need to know where these places are. Theres a guy from Amsterdam named Arjan who went to some of these places, traded hybridized dutch seeds for "pure" heirlooms. The farmers then planted these hybrids alongside their crops, and their crops were no longer "pure". Leaving Arjan as the sole owner of those "pure" genetics.
